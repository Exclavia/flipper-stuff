# Bananarino (Banana app edit)

Just a dumb edit I made of the Banana flipper app that adds little text congrats every 50 points and keeps track of how many times you achieved 50 points, as well as swapping out the banana graphic, and adding a reset progress menu option.
More or less was just messing around with apps. Thought it was funny though.
